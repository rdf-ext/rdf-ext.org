# About

RDF-Ext is a JavaScript library that extends the [RDF/JS](#rdf-js) specs to handle RDF data in a developer-friendly way.

## RDF/JS

The core interfaces of RDF-Ext are based on the work by the [RDF JavaScript Libraries Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/rdfjs/).
Interfaces of the following specifications are used:

- [RDF/JS: Data model](http://rdf.js.org/data-model-spec/)
- [RDF/JS: Dataset](https://rdf.js.org/dataset-spec/)
- [RDF/JS: Stream interfaces](http://rdf.js.org/stream-spec/)
