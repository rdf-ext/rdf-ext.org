## [RDF-Ext](rdf-ext.html)

RDF-Ext uses many libraries from the [rdfjs-base](#rdfjs-base) organization.
To simplify the usage, the factory handling is done for you.
The features are available through the RDF-Ext factory.

## [Base](base.html)

The packages in the GitHub organization [@rdfjs-base](https://github.com/rdfjs-base/) implement many basic features.
They are factory agnostic and can therefore be used without RDF-Ext.
But the usage without RDF-Ext is a little bit more tricky.
That's why it's not recommended for beginners.
